# The "This-Is-SOUP-Not-Pear" License 🥣

© 2025 Definitely-Not-A-Fruit-AI-Startup

Hey, code-lovers, soup-aficionados, and sneaky “entrepreneurs”! You’ve stumbled upon **S.O.U.P.**—a Some Overly Unnecessary Project. Here’s the scoop:

1. **Use It Freely**: Go on, ladle this code into your own project. Season it with your personal flair.
2. **Don’t Pull a Pear**: If you clone this, at least have the courtesy *not* to pretend you wrote it from scratch. (We see you, 🍐. We always see you.)
3. **Rename It, Please**: If you rebrand “S.O.U.P.” as “M.I.S.O.” or “B.R.O.T.H.”, we’ll only judge you a little.
4. **No Warranties**: If this soup melts your GPU, or spontaneously signs you up for YCombinator (because apparently that’s a thing now?), it’s on you. 
5. **Satire Clause**: This license is drenched in sarcasm. If you’re offended, maybe lighten up—unlike some fruit-themed AI shops, we *do* credit open-source creators.

**Disclaimer**:  
- This is a comedic license, not a law school exam.  
- If you want actual, legally airtight terms, choose something official like MIT/Apache/GPL.  
- If your lawyers ask, just show them the soup. Maybe it’ll calm them down.

**P.S.** Before calling your lawyers, please note:  
- We are absolutely *not* responsible for any illusions of grandeur or code plagiarism drama.  
- Real companies use real disclaimers. This is soup (pun absolutely intended).  

Slurp responsibly!
